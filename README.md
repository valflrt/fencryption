# Fencryption (rust)

A remake of [Fencryption](https://github.com/valflrt/fencryption) but in rust (because typescript sucks a lil' bit for this kind of project...).

## Todo

- [ ] Add default file encryption features
- [ ] Provide better help about commands
- [ ] Add io stream enc-/decryption features

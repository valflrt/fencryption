# Fencryption (rust)

A remake of [Fencryption](https://github.com/valflrt/fencryption) but in rust (because typescript sucks a lil' bit for this kind of project...).

## Todo

- [x] Provide better help about commands
- [x] Add default file encryption features
- [x] Add io stream enc-/decryption features
- [ ] Enhance log and error handling
- [ ] Setup cli
